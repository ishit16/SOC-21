# World_Clock

A flutter application to develop a world clock app which shows the current timings of different regions around the world.

## Getting Started

Open this app and select the region you want to know the time for. In this prototype I have included only specific regions but the same idea can be applied to include all the regions of the world.

## Working

* Used an API for fetching time of different countries/regions.
